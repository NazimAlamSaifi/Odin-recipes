        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Marinate the Chicken:</li>
            <ul><li>In a large bowl, combine yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, turmeric, red chili powder,<br> 
                garam masala, cumin, coriander, lemon juice, and salt. Add the chicken pieces,<br> 
                ensuring they're evenly coated.</li></ul>
            <ul><li>Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour (preferably overnight for more flavor).</li></ul>
            <li>Prepare the Rice:</li>
            <ul><li>Rinse the basmati rice in cold water several times until the water runs clear.</li></ul>
            <ul><li>Bring 4 cups of water to a boil in a large pot. Add salt, cardamom, cloves, bay leaf, and cinnamon stick.</li></ul>
            <ul><li>Add the rinsed rice and cook until the rice is about 70% cooked (the grains should still be firm). Drain and set aside.</li></ul>
            <li>Toast the buns:</li>
            <ul><li>Heat ghee (or oil) in a large skillet over medium heat.<br>
                Add the thinly sliced onions and fry until golden brown and crispy. Set some aside for garnish.</li></ul>
            <li>Cook the Chicken:</li>
            <ul><li>In the same skillet (add more ghee if needed), add the marinated chicken and cook on medium-high heat<br>
                until the chicken is browned and partially cooked through (about 8-10 minutes).</li></ul>
            <ul><li>Add the green chilies (if using) and half of the chopped coriander and mint leaves. Stir well and set aside.</li></ul>
            <li>Layer the Biryani:</li>
            <ul><li>In a large, heavy-bottomed pot, start layering the biryani.</li></ul>
            <ul><li>First, spread a layer of the partially cooked chicken at the bottom.</li></ul>
            <ul><li>Then, add a layer of the partially cooked rice on top of the chicken.</li></ul>
            <ul><li>Sprinkle the remaining chopped coriander and mint over the rice.</li></ul>
            <ul><li>Drizzle the saffron-infused milk on top of the rice.</li></ul>
            <li>Dum Cooking (Slow Cooking):</li>
            <ul><li>Cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid. You can seal the edges with dough (optional) to ensure no steam escapes.</li></ul>
            <ul><li>Cook on low heat for 20-25 minutes. This process, called "dum," allows the flavors to meld together while the rice finishes cooking.</li></ul>
            <li>Serve:</li>
            <ul><li>Once cooked, gently fluff the biryani with a fork to mix the layers without breaking the rice.</li></ul>
            <ul><li>Garnish with crispy fried onions, extra coriander leaves, and serve hot with raita (yogurt sauce) or a simple cucumber salad.</li></ul>
        </ol>
