        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven: Heat your oven to its highest setting (usually around 250°C or 500°F). If you have a pizza stone, place it in the oven to preheat as well.</li>
            <li>Prepare the dough: Roll out the pizza dough on a floured surface until it reaches your desired thickness.</li>
            <li>Assemble the pizza: Spread a thin layer of tomato sauce over the dough, leaving a small border for the crust. Place slices of fresh mozzarella evenly over the sauce.</li>
            <li>Season: Drizzle with olive oil, then sprinkle oregano, a bit of salt, and (if you like) crushed red pepper flakes over the top.</li>
            <li>Bake: Transfer the pizza to the oven (or pizza stone) and bake for about 8-10 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbly and slightly browned.</li>
            <li>Finish with basil: Remove the pizza from the oven and immediately add fresh basil leaves. Drizzle a bit more olive oil if desired and sprinkle with parmesan cheese.</li>
            <li>Serve: Slice and serve hot!</li>
        </ol>
